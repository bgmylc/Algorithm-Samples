You are given a string S, in which one letter occurs twice every other letter occurs at most once.

```
Fun solution(S: String): String
```

which, given a string S, return a single-character string: the letter that occurs twice.

**Examples:**

1. Given S = "aba" the function shoul return "a".
2. Given S = "zz" the function should return "z"
3. Given S = "codility", the function should return "i"

**Assume That:**

* the length of the string S is within the range [2..27];
* string S consists only of lowercase letters (a-z);
* all letters in S are distinct except one, wich occurs twice.

In your solution focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
