* if *i* is a Multiple of both 3 and 5 print *FizzBuzz*
* if *i* is a Multiple of both 3 (but not 5) *Fizz*

**Explanation**

The numbers 3,6,9 and 12 are mutiples of 3 (but not 5) so print Fizz on those lines. The number 5 and 10 are mutiples of 5 (But not 3) so print Buzz on those lines. The number 15 is a mutiple of both 3 and 5 so print FizzBuzz on that line. None of the other values is a multiple of either 3 or 5, so print the value of i on those lines.
